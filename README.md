# Pomodore
Pomodoro Timer written in Java Swing.

Pomodoro is an effective way to manage your time while working/studying/learning in order to focus throughout the session.
It uses a cycle system that gives a good balance between work and rest.

The Timer is fully customisable, so it covers all the configurations you can think of.
If the goal is a task that requires getting into the "zone" of work, the work time can be can be adjusted to meet these needs.

## How to use:
1. Set the variables according to the task.
2. During the work cycle, you should be fully focused on the work at hand, i.e. distractions should be as far away as possible.
3. Between the work cycles there is a small break cycle where the user should do anything but think about the work.
e.g. exercise, have a snack or have a chat.
The key is not to think about the task.
4. After each big cycle (call it a pomodoro) there is a longer break.

There are predefined timer presets that can be adjusted so that the variables don't have to be adjusted each time you start the application.

## expected features:
- TODO List to keep track of your work
